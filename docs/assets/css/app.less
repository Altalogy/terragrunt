# We need this frontmatter for Jekyll to compile the less code
# Github Pages do not support LESS and custom plugins. The core styles were
# built and copy-paste from "_site/assets/css/app.css" to the "assets/css/app_less.css".
#
# If you want to add new rules or override those from LESS, you can do this with SASS and styles.scss.
# If you want more deep changes in app_less.css:
# 1. In Gemfile, switch from "github-pages" to "jekyll".
# 2. Make changes in "assets/css/less/*" files
# 3. Build project with "JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build"
# 4. Copy "_site/assets/css/app.css" to the "assets/css/app_less.css"
# 5. Switch back from "jekyll" to "github-pages" in Gemfile
